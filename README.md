# Book Library Project

This project is developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) boot camp.

The main objectives of this projects are:
- Work with an array and objects inside the array
- Create a form that the user can submit it's own books.
- Integrate the UI with the array

What I've learned:
- How to used forms and prevent default actions
- How to work with arrays
- How to push content into the array and render for the user
- Simple management of an object database
